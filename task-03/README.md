### 3. [Update Data from Form Input](https://dev.to/cesareferrari/handling-input-field-updates-in-react-47oe)

Before you start coding make sure to:

- Navigate to the directory `task-03` in your terminal
- Run `npm i` or `npm install`

In this React challenge, we'll update data using an `<input>` field.

The main tasks are:

- Use an `<input>` field to accept text
- Update your UI based on that input field
- Use React state to automatically update your UI
